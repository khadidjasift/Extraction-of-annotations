# Extraction of Annotations in Medical Images

## Introduction
This repository is dedicated to the development of algorithms for extracting annotations in medical images. Our goal is to provide robust methods for enhancing medical image analysis through accurate feature detection and extraction.

## Methods

We've developed two main methods for annotation extraction:

### Method 01

The first method involves advanced image processing techniques to identify key features within medical images. For more details, please see [Issue #1](https://github.com/khadidjasift/Extraction-of-annotations/issues/1#issue-2204059746).

#### Results for Method 01

The results of applying Method 01 can be viewed https://github.com/khadidjasift/Extraction-of-annotations/issues/3#issue-2204060804
### Method 02

Our second method introduces a novel approach to extract annotations with improved accuracy.

#### Results for Method 02

See the outcomes of Method 02 in [Issue #5](https://github.com/khadidjasift/Extraction-of-annotations/issues/5#issue-2204061706).
